Hello everyone,

It's been almost three years since I last updated my blog. So much has changed since then. I want to share some of my recent experiences with you.

First, my whole family and I have moved to a new country. It was a big change for us. We are still getting used to everything.

In my job, I've noticed that front-end technology is not as demanding as I thought it would be. Instead, good communication in English has become the most important skill for me. English is now the main barrier in my life. It affects my job, my promotion, and everything in my career.

So, I have decided to start learning English every day. I must get back into study mode and solve this problem quickly. Improving my English is my top priority now.
