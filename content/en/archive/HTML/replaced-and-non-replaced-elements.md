Suddenly heard about this concept. Never heard of it before. So I looked it up to learn more.

## Replaced and Non-Replaced Elements

* Replaced elements generally refer to elements that have default styles, such as: img, input, textarea, select, object

* Non-replaced elements are the opposite, that is, all elements other than replaced elements like: img, input, textarea, select, object.
