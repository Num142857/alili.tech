Two days ago in the morning at company, computer started up. Found mouse couldn't be used.

After fiddling around, found computer Bluetooth became a wavy line. Shows Bluetooth unavailable.

Fiddled for a long time, computer system also upgraded to latest version. Restarted several times, Bluetooth still in unavailable state.

Searched Baidu, online also has similar problem solutions.

```
1. Shutdown


2. Press shift+control+option+power simultaneously, hold for 5 seconds


3. Press power key first, then immediately press option+command+p+r simultaneously,
Wait for mac to make 4 Duang~ sounds, then release, system will automatically start


4. Bluetooth returns to normal
```

But some netizens tried it and it was successful.

I followed this method, tried several times, Bluetooth still unavailable. But in computer recovery mode, mouse is usable. Shows Bluetooth is not broken.

> Finally I unplugged all USB devices connected to computer. Tried again once.

Miracle happened, Bluetooth returned to normal. If friends encounter similar situations, best to unplug all USB devices like me. Then follow the above method and try once. Should be able to solve the problem.
