# Nintendo Switch
Nintendo Switch is an electronic game console produced by Nintendo, released in Japan, North America, Europe and Hong Kong on March 3, 2017, and in South Korea and Taiwan on December 1 of the same year. Has detachable controllers and separable host, game media uses proprietary cartridges.
Host processor uses NVIDIA customized Tegra X1 system-on-chip, this is Nintendo's first time using NVIDIA's system-on-chip.
Nintendo Switch host's built-in storage space is 32GB, can be expanded using microSD, maximum supports microSDXC standard, maximum supports 2TB capacity; Host at initial system 1.0.0 can only support up to microSD standard, system 2.0.0 update provided on release day enables support for microSDXC standard.

# Hack Principle
Nintendo Switch (Nintendo switch) CPU uses Nvidia X1 T210 processor, has an accessible engineering mode (Recovery Mode), abbreviated RCM,
Nintendo Switch's right joycon connection port hides a special metal pin (pin10). If during startup, hold volume key +, and ground this pin (pin1,7,9), Nintendo Switch can enter engineering mode (RCM), thus can run custom code.

You can easily buy this short connector on Taobao. Can also make it very conveniently through tin foil, pins or 3D printing. Short connector's function is to ground this special pin.
From above, Nintendo Switch hack relies on engineering mode based on Nvidia X1 T210 processor. Inject (launch) special code to boot custom system or programs. Achieve hack.

This method won't be blocked, normal system updates won't affect hack. Cannot block through software level. Because engineering mode startup priority is higher than system. No matter what system updates in the future, entering RCM (engineering mode is no problem), in upcoming 6.0 version, only changed game file storage method, indirectly preventing hack, currently TX1.9 version has already added hack.

Precisely because hack is based on startup short circuit entering engineering mode principle, after any shutdown, hack will fail, need to redo hack.

# What Can Be Done After Hack, Are There Any Problems
Nintendo Switch's system essentially can be seen as a modified LINUX operating system. Through hack, compile new programs, can Dump physical cartridge games you have, export saves, even can read novels, listen to music, as emulator for other game consoles. Playing hacked games is just one function.
So, when inserting storage card, because system formatting is different, will also have one upgrade situation, this is caused by different systems' file storage partition logic.

Extended reading: After hack you can install a real Linux distribution system Lakka,

Strongly recommend domestic developer's Lakka system, this is a project independent from abroad, let's thank him.

# About BAN
Because Nintendo verifies game file headers when connecting online (each game's file header is unique), so playing hacked games, modifying saves, etc., will all lead to Ban, currently mainly manifests as two types,
Normal BAN: Specific manifestation is cannot play online games, cannot enter Eshop (store), will also have error codes appear, but currently game normal updates (like updating Chinese language) are not affected. You can understand Ban as limiting network functionality.
More severe ban measures, everyone calls Super Ban, specific manifestation is after connecting online error code 2137-7403 appears, host cannot update, games and dlc also cannot update, meaning Nintendo added your host serial number to blacklist, directly disconnected all connections with Nintendo.

You can backup system after hack. But currently friends have appeared who bricked because not familiar with backup restore process, so no link here, if you want to do this, remember "one machine one code", your own backup files can only be used by yourself, cannot use others'. Also when restoring partitions, pay attention not to restore wrong files, once misoperation, is unrecoverable brick.

I more suggest, after hack disconnect network, before wanting to connect online, reset host then connect online, can mostly go legit. This risk is smaller.

# Hack Methods

Currently, Nintendo Switch hack has two major branches.
One type is free Atmosphere/REI/TX installer. This type only supports NSP format game installation. Slightly complex
One type is paid TX OS. This type supports cartridge DUMPed XCI format, also supports NSP installation.

Because code is public, hack methods also become gradually diverse, hope you understand specific principles, rather than obsessing over specific hack method, roughly speaking, simple popular ones in forums are the best hack methods. Forums have many good integration packages, you can choose any one to install.
