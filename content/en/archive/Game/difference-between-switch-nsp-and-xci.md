Recently working on Switch, encountered two game formats during game installation, respectively

* xci
* nsp

## What's the Difference Between Them?

In actual use:
xci, throw into memory card can use,
nsp, need to install before can use
Simple understanding is, xci is portable software (correctly should be ISO), nsp is installer software.

Because xci is equivalent to cartridge, doesn't need installation, needs switching.
nsp is equivalent to digital version, needs installation, after installation can play directly

All DLCs or update packages are nsp format.

When we use xci format software, if we want to install updates upgrade packages, they're all nsp format, directly installing nsp effect is the same.

In normal use, I like nsp, after installation can directly open software, don't need to switch again. Personally think using nsp is once and for all.

## About Localization

Actually both can be localized. Two formats only have usage differences, others have no difference.
