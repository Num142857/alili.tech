# FAQ
## Does localization affect games? 
Generally localization causing game crashes is due to text errors, new localization has already fixed most issues. Of course actual effects still need testing.

## Can 5.1 system use it?
Although 5.1 system installing 6.0 localization can boot. But doesn't guarantee stability. Also doesn't guarantee it works.

## What if installer won't open?
Install 
[Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-CN/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
Installer doesn't support 32-bit systems, so use overwrite version.

## What if cannot boot after installing localization?
Don't worry, uninstall localization, won't affect original system.

## Some game crash issues
If your game itself has localization patch, might crash (currently known Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2).

Some game crashes are hack tool's own issues. Like SXOS2.0 extremely unstable. Atmosphere some games cannot run and save. If you use SXOS 2.xx, running XCI games has high chance of crash, should be unrelated to localization.

SXOS (2.0, 2.0.1, 2.1) XCI game sleep crash issue If your game itself uses localization, sleep has high chance of crash. Unrelated to system localization.

## About 6.0.1 System
According to testing, 6.0.1 system didn't change text, so 6.0 localization is fully compatible.
