Today is the last working day of the year, now I'm on the high-speed rail. Already used to using computer to work on something on high-speed rail.
Looking back, don't know how many versions I've released on high-speed rail, fixed how many bugs. Haha~

Looking back at 2018, for me it's legendary, it's tortuous, even a bit depressing. Fortunately personal growth wasn't delayed by objective reasons.

## My Team

Thinking back to July this year, the front-end team I personally built was disbanded due to macro environment reasons, really heartbreaking.
If developed normally, I think should be able to build into my Dream Team. At least everyone is so passionate about technology.

## Growth Must Race Against Time

But everything doesn't matter, this year I just turned 26, there will be opportunities in the future. I often comfort myself like this. I'm afraid in two more years, this won't be a reason for self-comfort anymore.
The only thing to do is personal growth must race against time.

This year when attending ng china, one speech that left a very deep impression on me was Xue Lang's.
One part roughly means according to our current information explosion era, our growth should be ten years earlier than ancients:

Twenty而立 (Established at twenty)

Thirty不惑 (No confusion at thirty)

Forty知天命 (Know destiny at forty)

Fifty耳顺 (Accepting at fifty)

Sixty从心所欲 (Follow heart's desire at sixty)

Regarding this, I fully agree.

## Anxious Year

2018 for me, is an anxious year. Because of my own anxiety, prompted myself to constantly learn and progress every day~
Of course this year also missed many good opportunities. Now thinking about it, still too young, haven't seen big shots, saw idol immediately got scared.
But still ready at all times, face new challenges at any time.

## About Blog
This year blog can be said to be a major upgrade, interface looks similar, but internally basically rewritten.
Also specifically did SEO, even ran to segmentfault to place ads for a week, hahaha~
Although promotion effect didn't meet expectations~

Previously didn't specifically do statistics, since October launched statistics, looked at website total visits already reached 100K+.
I don't know what other bloggers' website data is like, but according to current trend.
Visits are still slowly increasing. Seeing those statistics every day is still very interesting.

From previously forcing myself to write one article per week, to now forcing myself to write three articles per week. Write some things I'm doing, seeing, interesting technical summaries. Sometimes some very small technical points, some are things I've researched for a long time, with certain systematic nature. Writing blog for me is a very efficient learning method. Will probably continue in the future. But can't say persistence, gradually has become a hobby and habit.
Hope this habit can let my skills have a place to shine. Have an organization mutually beneficial with me, grow together, get what each wants.

## About Family
About family, this year January my son Xiao Kele was born, until Xiao Kele was born for a long time, I couldn't make myself really like children.
Don't know if it's because I'm an only child or never interacted with people younger than me. Now looking, most friends around me are five six seven eight years older than me.
But now, the longer we interact, the deeper this bond with son becomes. Hope in the future can become good friends with him, even good brothers, good mentor.

At least the world we see now is much bigger than our parents' generation. We need to learn parents' wisdom, re-examine and view this world.
Wisdom this thing, very interesting~ No matter which era it's placed in, can be directly reused.

## About Technology
This year I heard some words that made me deeply think. A colleague told me: "I don't have as much passion for technology as you, I'm just making a living".
I very much reject this statement, but have to admit many people are like this. Isn't this like many times in interviews, others ask if you're from computer science background.

I ask myself, am I learning so much knowledge to make a living? Finally I thought about it, got the answer: Learning these technologies is a way for me to understand this world.
I think I can have such an understanding, because I'm relatively lucky~ Although life pressure still exists, but not that great~ right? (Suddenly thought of that joke~)

I always feel I have a problem, my eyes can only see people better than me, seeing them so excellent, making myself extremely anxious.

Sometimes I tell myself, should I occasionally look back? Can let myself feel relieved~ But many times feel I can't do it?
Is this a manifestation of habitual seeing excellence and thinking of improvement~ I think this is a disease, over time will more or less have some problems.

## About 2019

2019 I think there's nothing to plan, if there really is a plan then it's to continue doing things I've been persisting in 2018.
