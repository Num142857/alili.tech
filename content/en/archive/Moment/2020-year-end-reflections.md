Finally can write this article at this critical time node, although now it's already March 2021.
But never found a very good opportunity to write this article.

Because of pandemic reasons, I know everyone's 2020 has too many stories to tell.
I'm the same, this year is also a critical year of growth for me.

## About Work

Because last year had certain progress in cross-platform aspects, after company organizational structure adjustment, established Light Application Group.
Specifically doing cross-platform direction technical research to support company business development.

Over the year, encountered extremely many problems, for me pressure is also extremely great, often because some very difficult problems causing business might not go online.
But problems are always found solutions before going online. This happened too many times, for me personally, heart also got very great training.
Over the year, my catchphrase became `this problem is not big`.
Not only encouraging myself, as the bug backup man in the team, also constantly giving confidence to classmates encountering problems.
This might be the year I encountered most problems and most difficult in my front-end career. But results are quite good.
In one year, we expanded our service to 8 platforms~ 
During this period, can't say there were no thoughts of giving up, because the more difficult problems encountered, everyone was actually full of confidence~
Many times, everyone might feel, even if they can't solve it themselves, at least I'm backing them up~
I admit, there's definitely gambling involved, but if time limit is one year, we won the bet.
But brings a problem, because difficult problems solved more, achievement feeling triggered becomes harder and harder.

But in business aspects, although everyone worked very hard, but didn't have substantive progress. This is very tiring.
In front of pandemic, most companies more or less have similar problems.
It's like no matter what method used, data is like a dead pig not afraid of boiling water, no substantive waves~

This makes everyone very tired, hope in next stage can rediscover ourselves.

## About Myself

Speaking of rediscovering ourselves, I just thought, have I ever gotten myself.
Or have some misunderstanding about myself. 
For programmer me, maybe previously could enter flow state every day, I miss that.
Entering flow is a whole day, when getting off work might have some troubles enter brain, most time is an excited and immersed world.
