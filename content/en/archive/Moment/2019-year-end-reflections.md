This year can be said to be a fulfilling year, entered a new company. Everything changed, career very smooth. Also very grateful to my colleagues for their help and inspiration this year.

Compared to 2018, it's a leap in growth. The more I think about it, the more I feel should have come to such a company earlier, fully showcase myself.

In the new company, all previous ideas about front-end automation were fully implemented company-wide.
Micro-frontend architecture also got real application in company's backend management system.
And achieved certain results in Taro multi-platform isomorphic applications.

## My Team

After doing several good things in the company, I started leading a team again, this time completely different from before.
Everyone meshed very well, thoroughly felt the charm of cooperation.
Finally everyone's results got company recognition, all got satisfactory performance.

Next three months, I'll promote multi-platform component library construction, a component library that truly supports H5, WeChat Mini Program, RN.
Everyone is very positive about this, if successful, I think this is a very remarkable thing.
Hope first quarter this year can have a very good result.

## About Blog
This year blog updates might not be particularly frequent, main reason is still busy (lazy).
Originally wanted to properly introduce our automation solution, and some multi-platform isomorphic exploration and accumulation.
Finally still didn't write it out. For 2020, still best to output these accumulations and thoughts.

## About Technology
This year's technology, all are real implementations of last year's ideas, including micro-frontend, automation, multi-platform isomorphic aspects.
But recently I keep asking myself, how to do 1 person's work of 10 people.
Keep asking keep asking, always many ideas pop up, whether low-code or D2C are all very good efficiency tools.

Recently team started exploring Taro's D2C, preliminary calculation. Writing UI code can maximize 12x improvement.
Using D2C method to build multi-platform applications, many style problems can be mechanically solved, this way everyone might directly ignore style differences between platforms.
And based on design drafts, can write a page in one minute. This is a qualitative leap for the team.
This is a very good direction.

## About 2020

What needs to be done still needs to continue, some colleagues are still obsessed with automation things.

I feel for current team, if engineering automation spends a lot more effort, for current benefits it's diminishing returns.

Because existing automation architecture already fully meets current development needs. I think we need to put more effort elsewhere. To achieve overall team efficiency improvement.

First half of 2020, will collaborate with design department on an external website, mainly sharing company's technology and design accumulation. Then everyone please wait and see.
