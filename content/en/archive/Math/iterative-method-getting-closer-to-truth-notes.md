## What is the Iterative Method?

It's continuously using old variable values to recursively calculate new variable values.

### Short Story:

> An ancient Indian king loved chess and planned to heavily reward the inventor of chess, Prime Minister Sissa ben Dahir. This clever minister pointed to the chessboard and said to the king: "Your Majesty, I don't want any other reward. Please place 1 grain of wheat in the first small square of this chessboard, 2 grains in the second small square, 4 grains in the third small square, and so on. Each small square has twice as many wheat grains as the previous small square, until all 64 squares are filled. Then give all the wheat grains on the chessboard to your servant!" The king thought it was a trivial matter and readily agreed. However, when they started placing wheat grains, the king discovered that before reaching the twentieth square, one bag of wheat was already empty. As bag after bag of wheat was placed into the chessboard squares, the king quickly realized that even bringing all of India's grain couldn't fulfill his promise to Dahir.

Calculate the final number of wheat grains through a function.

### Computer Languages Are Particularly Suitable

```js

function getNumberOfWheat(grid){
numberOfWheatInGrid = 0; // Number of wheat grains in current square 
let numberOfWheatInGrid = 1; // Number of wheat grains in first square 

// Place one grain first
sum += numberOfWheatInGrid; 

for (let i = 2; i <= grid; i ++) {         
    numberOfWheatInGrid *= 2;
    // Number of wheat grains in current square is 2 times the previous square 
    sum += numberOfWheatInGrid; 
    // Accumulate total wheat grains 
    } 
    return sum;
}

// Calculate quantity for 64 squares
console.log(getNumberOfWheat(64))

```

## Specific Applications?

* `Find exact or approximate solutions to numerical values`. Typical methods include the bisection method and Newton's iterative method.

* `Search for target values within a certain range`. Typical methods include binary search.

* `Iteration in machine learning algorithms`. There are many related algorithms or models, such as K-means clustering, PageRank's Markov chain, gradient descent, etc. The reason iterative methods are widely used in machine learning is because `often the process of machine learning is to find a local optimal solution based on known data and certain assumptions`. Iterative methods can help learning algorithms search step by step until they find such solutions.

### Practice Bisection Method to Find Exact or Approximate Solutions to Equations

Problem: Find the square root of 10

Approach: We need to first look at the middle value between 1 and 10, which is 11/2=5.5. The square of 5.5 is greater than 10, so we need a smaller value, look at 3.25 between 5.5 and 1. Since the square of 3.25 is also greater than 10, continue looking at the value between 3.25 and 1, which is 2.125. At this point, the square of 2.125 is less than 10, so look at the value between 2.125 and 3.25, continue until we find a number whose square is exactly 10

```js

/** * 
 * @Description: Calculate square root of positive integer greater than 1 
 * @param n-Number to be calculated, deltaThreshold-Threshold of error, maxTry-Maximum number of binary searches
 * @return double-Solution of square root 
 * */

function getSqureRoot(n, deltaThreshold, maxTry) {
    // Parameters don't meet conditions, return -1
    if (n <= 1) { return -1.0; }

    let min = 1.0;
    let max = n;
    
    // Start using number of attempts and expected progress to iteratively search for results
    for (let i = 0; i < maxTry; i++) {
        // Take a middle number
        let middle = (min + max) / 2;
        // Start squaring
        let square = middle * middle;

        // See if square result meets our requirements
        // Math.abs takes absolute value
        let delta = Math.abs((square / n) - 1);

        // Progress meets requirements, return correct value
        if (delta <= deltaThreshold) {
            // Found square root that meets conditions
            return middle;
        } else {
            // Squared result is greater than number n to be calculated
            if (square > n) {
                // Redefine max
                max = middle;
            } else {
                // If less, redefine min
                min = middle;
            }
        }
    }
    // All iterations completed, no result return -2
    return -2.0;
}



// Start solving

  let number = 10;

  // Find square root of 10
  // Progress is 0.000001
  // Maximum 10000 iterations
  let squareRoot = getSqureRoot(number, 0.000001, 10000);


  if (squareRoot == -1) {
   console.log("Please enter an integer greater than 1");
  } else if (squareRoot == -2) {
   console.log("Solution not found");
  } else {
   console.log(`Square root of ${number} is ${squareRoot}`);
  }
