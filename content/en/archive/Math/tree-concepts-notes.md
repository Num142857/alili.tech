## Basic Concepts of Trees

A tree is a data structure composed of nodes or vertices and edges (possibly nonlinear) that does not contain any cycles. A tree without nodes is called an empty (null or empty) tree. A non-empty tree includes a root node and (likely) multiple additional nodes, all nodes forming a multi-level hierarchical structure.

> A tree is a special type of graph (graphs will be mentioned in subsequent articles).

### Prefix Tree (Trie)

### Directed Tree
Its edges have direction. A tree is a connected graph without simple circuits.

The number of edges starting from node v is called the `outdegree` of v. The number of edges ending at v is called the `indegree` of v. In the figure above, node v2 has an indegree of 1 and an outdegree of 2.

### Circuits and Connectivity

### Height and Nodes

## Binary Tree
Binary trees are further divided into: perfect binary tree, complete binary tree, full binary tree

### Perfect Binary Tree (Full Binary Tree)
Every node except leaf nodes has two child nodes, and every level (including the last level) is completely filled.

### Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree satisfies a perfect binary tree from the root node to the second-to-last level. The last level can be incompletely filled, with all leaf nodes aligned to the left.

### Full Binary Tree
All non-leaf nodes have a degree of 2.
In other words: If you have children, you must have exactly two children.
