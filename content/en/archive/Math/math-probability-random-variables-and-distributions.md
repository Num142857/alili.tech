## Random Variable

* Let the sample space of random experiment be S, X = X(e) is a real-valued single-valued function defined on sample space S. X = X(e) is called a random variable.
* Essentially a function about basic events, independent variable is basic event, dependent variable is function value.

### Random Experiment:

Satisfies: 

* (1) Repeatability: Experiment can be repeated under same conditions;
  
* (2) Knowability: Each experiment has more than one possible result, and all possible results of experiment can be clearly identified in advance;
  
* (3) Uncertainty: Before conducting an experiment, cannot determine which result will appear, but one of the results must appear.

### Sample Space:
The set of all basic results of a random experiment is called the sample space. Elements of sample space are called sample points or basic events. That is, sample space is essentially a set, each element is a result of one random experiment.


### Sample and Random Variable:
Samples in mathematical statistics have duality, that is, samples can be viewed both as a set of observed values and as random variables.

* First, before sampling. Cannot determine sample's observed values, so can be viewed as random variables.
  
* Second, after sample is extracted and observed, sample has specific observed values, so can be viewed as a set of determined values.


## Probability Distribution

Let's look at the simplest coin toss event. Theoretically, probability of heads and tails are both 50%

### Try with Code

```js

function flipCoin(){
    for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
        // Round random number
        let randomNum = Math.round(Math.random())
        // If random is 1 then heads
        if(randomNum === 1){
            console.log('Heads')
        }else{
            console.log('Tails')
        }
    }

}

flipCoin()

```

Try 10 times result:

Try 1000 times

* More sampling times in statistics, closer to theoretical situation

* Probability distribution actually describes probability law of random variables.

## Discrete Distribution Models

### Bernoulli Distribution
This is distribution of a single random variable, and this variable only has two values, 0 or 1.

![Figure 5](https://incomparable9527.coding.net/p/imageBed/d/imageBed/git/raw/master/857fa1c74e576b0da786c1426090e02a008172a9f3cd01d867c7a7f3580ff1b2.png)  

or

```
Example:

Assume you want to have children, probability of boy is p, probability of girl is 1-p

Bernoulli experiment: Have one child

Bernoulli distribution: Have one child, probability of boy is p, probability of girl is 1-p, this is Bernoulli distribution
```

## Categorical Distribution (also called Multinoulli Distribution)

It describes a single random variable with k different states. Here k is a finite value, if k is 2, then categorical distribution becomes Bernoulli distribution. I've listed the formula and diagram of this distribution.

## Normal Distribution

Formula:
![Figure 9](https://incomparable9527.coding.net/p/imageBed/d/imageBed/git/raw/master/6dc708e463f8c158c107510d1b735dd2b2bb94bfa3f670474a090ad9b38b6e00.png)  


In this formula there are two parameters, μ represents mean, σ represents variance.
