## Random Variable

* Let the sample space of a random experiment be S, X = X(e) is a real-valued single-valued function defined on sample space S. X = X(e) is called a random variable.
* Essentially a function about basic events, where the independent variable is the basic event and the dependent variable is the function value.

### Random Experiment:

Must satisfy: 

* (1) Repeatability: The experiment can be repeated under the same conditions;
  
* (2) Knowability: Each experiment has more than one possible result, and all possible results of the experiment can be clearly identified in advance;
  
* (3) Uncertainty: Before conducting an experiment, it's impossible to determine which result will appear, but one of the results must appear.

### Sample Space:
The set of all basic results of a random experiment is called the sample space. Elements of the sample space are called sample points or basic events. That is, the sample space is essentially a set, where each element is a result of a random experiment.

### Sample and Random Variable:
Samples in mathematical statistics have duality, meaning samples can be viewed both as a set of observed values and as random variables.

* First, before sampling. The observed values of the sample cannot be determined, so it can be viewed as a random variable.
  
* Second, after the sample is drawn and observed, the sample has specific observed values, so it can be viewed as a set of determined values.

## Probability Distribution

Let's look at the simplest coin toss event. Theoretically, the probability of heads and tails is 50%

### Try with Code

```js

function flipCoin(){
    for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
        // Round the random number
        let randomNum = Math.round(Math.random())
        // If random is 1, it's heads
        if(randomNum === 1){
            console.log('Heads')
        }else{
            console.log('Tails')
        }
    }

}

flipCoin()

```

Results after 10 attempts:

After 1000 attempts:

* The more sampling times we count, the closer we get to the theoretical situation

* Probability distribution actually describes the probability pattern of random variables.

## Discrete Distribution Models

### Bernoulli Distribution
This is the distribution of a single random variable, and this variable can only take two values, 0 or 1.

![Figure 5](https://incomparable9527.coding.net/p/imageBed/d/imageBed/git/raw/master/857fa1c74e576b0da786c1426090e02a008172a9f3cd01d867c7a7f3580ff1b2.png)

```
Example:

Suppose you're having a child, probability of boy is p, probability of girl is 1-p

Bernoulli experiment: Have one child

Bernoulli distribution: Have one child, probability of boy is p, probability of girl is 1-p, this is the Bernoulli distribution
```

## Categorical Distribution (also called Multinoulli Distribution)

It describes a single random variable with k different states. Here k is a finite number. When k is 2, the categorical distribution becomes the Bernoulli distribution. I've listed the formula and diagram for this distribution.

## Normal Distribution

Formula:
![Figure 9](https://incomparable9527.coding.net/p/imageBed/d/imageBed/git/raw/master/6dc708e463f8c158c107510d1b735dd6b2bb94bfa3f670474a090ad9b38b6e00.png)  

There are two parameters in this formula, μ represents the mean, σ represents the variance.
