## Basic Concepts of Trees

A tree is a data structure composed of nodes or vertices and edges (possibly nonlinear) that does not contain any cycles. A tree without nodes is called an empty (null or empty) tree. A non-empty tree includes a root node and (likely) multiple additional nodes, all nodes forming a multi-level hierarchical structure.

> A tree is a special type of graph (graphs will be mentioned in subsequent articles).


### Prefix Tree (Trie)

### Directed Tree
Its edges have direction. And a tree is a connected graph without simple cycles.

The number of edges starting from node v is called v's `out-degree`. The number of edges ending at v is called v's `in-degree`. In the figure above, node v2's in-degree is 1, out-degree is 2.

### Cycles and Connectivity

### Height and Nodes

## Binary Tree
Binary trees are further divided into: perfect binary tree, complete binary tree, full binary tree

### Perfect Binary Tree (Full Binary Tree)
Every node except leaf nodes has two child nodes, every level (including the last level) is completely filled

### Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree satisfies perfect binary tree from root node to second-to-last level, the last level can be incompletely filled, its leaf nodes are all left-aligned

### Full Binary Tree
All non-leaf nodes have degree 2
In other words: as long as you have children, you must have two children.
