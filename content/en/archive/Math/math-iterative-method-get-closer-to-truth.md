## What is Iterative Method?

Continuously use old variable values to recursively calculate new variable values.

### Short Story:

> Ancient Indian King Shah loved chess, planned to heavily reward chess inventor Prime Minister Sissa Ben Dahir. This clever minister pointed at chessboard and said to king: "Your Majesty, I don't want other rewards, please put one grain in first small square of this chessboard, two grains in second small square, four grains in third small square, and so on, each small square has double grains of previous small square, until 64 squares filled, then give all grains on chessboard to your servant me!" King thought it trivial, happily agreed. But, when started putting grains, king discovered, before reaching twentieth square, one bag of wheat already empty. Then, bag after bag of wheat put into chessboard squares, king quickly realized, even bringing all India's grain, couldn't fulfill promise to Dahir.


Calculate final wheat quantity through a function.

### Very Suitable for Computer Languages

```js

function getNumberOfWheat(grid){
numberOfWheatInGrid = 0; // Current number of grains in grid 
let numberOfWheatInGrid = 1; // Number of grains in first grid 

// Put one grain first
sum += numberOfWheatInGrid; 

for (let i = 2; i <= grid; i ++) {         
    numberOfWheatInGrid *= 2;
    // Current number of grains in grid is 2 times previous grid 
    sum += numberOfWheatInGrid; 
    // Accumulate total grains 
    } 
    return sum;
}

// Calculate quantity for 64 grids
console.log(getNumberOfWheat(64))

```




## Specific Applications?

* `Find precise or approximate solutions of values`. Typical methods include Bisection method and Newton's iterative method.

* `Find target values within certain range`. Typical methods include binary search.

* `Iteration in machine learning algorithms`. Related algorithms or models are many, like K-means algorithm (K-means clustering), PageRank's Markov chain (Markov chain), Gradient descent method (Gradient descent), etc. Iterative method widely applied in machine learning because `many times machine learning process is, according to known data and certain assumptions, find a local optimal solution`. Iterative method can help learning algorithms gradually search, until discover such solution.


### Practice Bisection Method to Find Precise or Approximate Solutions of Equations

Problem: Find square root of 10

Idea: We need to first look at middle value between 1 and 10, which is 11/2=5.5. Square of 5.5 is greater than 10, so we want a smaller value, look at 3.25 between 5.5 and 1. Because square of 3.25 is also greater than 10, continue looking at value between 3.25 and 1, which is 2.125. At this time, square of 2.125 is less than 10, so look at value between 2.125 and 3.25, continue until discover some number's square is exactly 10

```js

/** * 
 * @Description: Calculate square root of positive integer greater than 1 
 * @param n-Number to find, deltaThreshold-Error threshold, maxTry-Maximum times for binary search
 * @return double-Square root solution 
 * */

function getSqureRoot(n, deltaThreshold, maxTry) {
    // Parameters don't meet conditions, return -1
    if (n <= 1) { return -1.0; }

    let min = 1.0;
    let max = n;
    
    // Start using attempt times and expected progress to iteratively find result
    for (let i = 0; i < maxTry; i++) {
        // Take a middle number
        let middle = (min + max) / 2;
        // Start squaring
        let square = middle * middle;

        // Check if square result meets our needs
        // Math.abs is to get absolute value
        let delta = Math.abs((square / n) - 1);

        // Progress meets, return correct value
        if (delta <= deltaThreshold) {
            // Found square root meeting conditions
            return middle;
        } else {
            // Squared result greater than number n to find
            if (square > n) {
                // Redefine max
                max = middle;
            } else {
                // Less than then redefine min
                min = middle;
            }
        }
    }
    // All iterations run, no result return -2
    return -2.0;
}



// Start solving

  let number = 10;

  // Find square root of 10
  // Progress is 0.000001
  // Maximum iterate 10000 times
  let squareRoot = getSqureRoot(number, 0.000001, 10000);


  if (squareRoot == -1) {
   console.log("Please enter integer greater than 1");
  } else if (squareRoot == -2) {
   console.log("Could not find solution");
  } else {
   console.log(`${number}'s square root is${squareRootString}`);
  }

```
