## Dynamic Programming (DP)

Many people abbreviate it as DP. Dynamic programming needs to derive the optimal solution of the final problem through optimal solutions of subproblems. Therefore, this method particularly emphasizes the transfer relationships between subproblems. We usually call these transfer relationships between subproblems `state transfer`, and call the expressions used to describe these state transfers `state transfer equations`.

## Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)

Proposed by Russian scientist Vladimir Levenshtein (graduated from Moscow State University's Department of Mathematics and Mechanics) in 1965. He won the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal in 2006 for his contributions to error-correcting code theory and information theory.

* Definition: Levenshtein distance, also called edit distance, refers to the minimum number of changes needed to edit text A into text B (each time can only add, delete or modify one character).

* Uses: Can be used to calculate string similarity, text similarity, spelling correction and plagiarism detection, etc.

* Advantages: Very high accuracy, if edit distance is small, text similarity is definitely high.

* Disadvantages: Low recall rate, because edit distance is related to text order. When text is the same but word order changes greatly, similarity becomes very low. For example, "光明正大" and "正大光明" actually mean the same thing. But edit distance is 4, completely unmatched.

### Calculation Analysis:

First define single character edit operations, there are only three types:

Insertion

Deletion

Substitution

Calculate edit distance between `mouuse` and `mouse`

> The min function here has three parameters, corresponding to edit distances of three situations respectively: substitution, insertion and deletion of characters.

### Code Implementation
```js

/**
  * @Description:  Use state transfer equation to calculate edit distance between two strings
  * @param a-First string, b-Second string
  * @return let-Edit distance between the two
  */
function getStrDistance( a,  b) {
    
    if (a == null || b == null) return -1;


  // Initialize two-dimensional table for recording state transfer
    let d = []
  for (let index = 0; index <= a.length; index++) {
     d.push(new Array(b.length))
  }


    // If i is 0, and j >= 0, then d[i, j] is j
    for (let j = 0; j <= b.length; j++) {
      d[0][j] = j;
    }
    
    // If i >= 0, and j is 0, then d[i, j] is i
    for (let i = 0; i <= a.length; i++) {
      d[i][0] = i;
    }

    // Current two-dimensional array state
    //   [
    //   [0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6  ],
    //   [ 1, <5 empty items> ],
    //   [ 2, <5 empty items> ],
    //   [ 3, <5 empty items> ],
    //   [ 4, <5 empty items> ],
    //   [ 5, <5 empty items> ],
    //   [ 6, <5 empty items> ]
    // ]

    // Implement state transfer equation
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
        
        let r = 0;
        if (a.charAt(i) != b.charAt(j)) {
          r = 1;
        } 

        // Mark all cells as needed
        // Coordinate +1 is to start recording data from second cell
        let first_append = d[i][j + 1] + 1;
        let second_append = d[i + 1][j] + 1;


        // Current cell records differences from previous comparison
        let replace = d[i][j] + r;

        console.log(a.charAt(i) , b.charAt(j))
        console.log(first_append, second_append)

        // Find minimum of first_append, second_append, replace
        // Respectively correspond to edit distances of three situations: substitution, insertion and deletion of characters
        let min = Math.min(first_append, second_append);
        min = Math.min(min, replace);

        // Accumulate all differences
        d[i + 1][j + 1] = min;
        
      }
    }

    // Current two-dimensional array state
    // [
    //   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    //   [1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    //   [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    //   [3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    //   [4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4],
    //   [5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3],
    //   [6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2]
    // ]
    // Output final accumulated value, which is their edit distance
    return d[a.length][b.length];
  }

```

## Afterword
This section is a bit confusing, record it and check more materials later for deeper understanding.
Examples are understood okay, but when it comes to application, it fails. Still need to do more problems...
