Graduated,
What you can't learn, that's called learning!!!!
:) 


## 2018-11-20
We learn so many technologies, just to give business more possibilities, let our imagination have a solid foundation rather than random thoughts.

## 2018-12-16
Turns out the motivation for all my learning comes entirely from anxiety about the future.

## 2018-12-28
My growth, seems to need to race against time.

## 2019-01-01
This year's goals established, two points total. One is English, one is weight~

## 2019-01-14
Bugs are a very important wealth of experience for the team

## 2019-01-25
Recently learning motivation decreased, blog also a bit lazy to update.
Mainly short-term goals achieved another one, anxiety decreased. This feeling is also quite good.

2020 finally shed the fat, lost nearly 40 pounds total.
Every day standing on the scale, know what to eat today, how much to eat.
Developed good lifestyle habits, weight maintained well.
But English kept memorizing words for two or three months, then stopped again.


## 2021-03-04

Today, I submitted resignation process. Mood extremely complex~
Need to leave this front-end team I personally built.
Last year spent under extremely high pressure. Although also got company recognition.
But seems still can't satisfy my sense of achievement.
The older I get, the harder it is to satisfy sense of achievement.
