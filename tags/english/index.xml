      <description>Hello everyone,
It&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since I last updated my blog. So much has changed since then. I want to share some of my recent experiences with you.

In my job, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that front-end technology is not as demanding as I thought it would be.</description>
